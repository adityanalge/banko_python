# banko_python
This is a simple card game I programmed using Python.
The rules are based on a game I played with my friends.
We used to call it BANKO. However, I do not know what its real name is or what it is called in different parts of the world.

<h2> RULES </h2>

You are presented two cards. 
The value of these cards are from 1 to 13, such that Ace equals 1 to King equals 13. 
The value is irrespective of the suit; e.g. Queen of Hearts = Queen of Spades = Queen of Clubs = Queen of Diamonds = 12

You are asked to choose amongst 3 options - 'Play', 'Pass' and 'Moonshot'.
A third card is then revealed which is your card.

<h5>If you chose Play:</h5>

You Win if the value of your card lies between the values of the cards presented to you before.

You Lose if the value of your card lies outside the values of the cards presented to you before or if it is equal to one or    both of the cards presented to you before.
  
<h5>If you choose Pass:</h5>
You neither Win nor Lose and simply skip the round. 

Your card will still be revealed and you will be shown if you would have won or lost the round. 

<h5>If you choose Moonshot:</h5>

You Win if the value of your card equals values of one or both of the cards presented to you before. If it equals both the cards, it is called as "Hiting The Moonshot".

You Lose if it doesn't equal either of the cards even if the value of your card lies between the values of the cards presented to you before.
  
<h4>Point System:</h4>

When you choose Play and you Win - Awarded 10 points.

When you choose Play and you Lose - Deducted 10 points.

When you choose Pass - No Change.

When you choose Moonshot and you Win and the value of your card equals one of the cards presented to you before - Awarded 30 points.

When you choose Moonshot and you Win and the value of your card equals both of the cards presented to you before - Awarded 60 points.
